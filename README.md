# Maven-Market-Report

Power BI Project Summary:
I led the development of a comprehensive Power BI solution for Maven Market, encompassing data integration, modeling, visualization, and advanced analytics. Here's a concise overview of the project:

Data Integration and Shaping:
•	Integrated multiple data sources including customer data, product data, store data, regional data, calendar data, return data, and transaction data.
•	Performed data shaping tasks such as data type conversions, column merging, conditional column creation, and data cleansing.
•	Ensured data consistency and accuracy by establishing relationships between tables and organizing data hierarchically.

Data Modeling:
•	Constructed a robust data model with lookup tables positioned above data tables for optimal performance.
•	Established one-to-many relationships between tables using appropriate primary and foreign keys.
•	Ensured filter context flowed downstream from lookup tables to data tables, maintaining data integrity.
•	Implemented snowflake schema for connecting stores to regions efficiently.

Report Design and Visualization:
•	Designed visually appealing reports with intuitive navigation and interactive elements.
•	Created calculated columns and measures to derive valuable insights from the data.
•	Implemented conditional formatting to highlight key metrics and trends effectively.
•	Developed KPI cards, matrix visuals, map visuals, treemap visuals, column charts, and gauge charts to present key performance indicators and trends.

Advanced Analytics:
•	Calculated advanced metrics such as return rate, profit margin, year-to-date revenue, 60-day revenue, revenue target, and more using DAX formulas.
•	Utilized iterators and functions to perform complex calculations and analyze trends over time.

Interactivity and User Experience:
•	Incorporated slicers, filters, and drill-down functionalities to enhance user interactivity and exploration.
•	Created bookmarks and notes to provide additional insights and context for specific data points or events.
•	Implemented actions and bookmarks for seamless navigation and storytelling within the report.

Project Management and Documentation:
•	Managed the end-to-end development lifecycle of the Power BI solution, from requirements gathering to deployment.
•	Documented data integration processes, data modeling strategies, and visualization techniques for future reference and knowledge sharing.
•	Collaborated with stakeholders to understand requirements and iteratively refine the solution to meet business needs.
Overall, the Power BI solution I developed for Maven Market showcases my expertise in data integration, modeling, visualization, and advanced analytics, along with my ability to deliver impactful insights to drive informed decision-making.
